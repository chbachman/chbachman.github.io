		<h1> Making of this website </h1>
		
		<p>
			This website was originally an <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> project. I wrote it while learning AngularJS back in 2016. Since then I've tired of having to relearn Angular JS, and I'm sure not going to rewrite it in a new framework given that AngularJS is now out of support.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I rewrote most of it in Pure CSS. This website does not and will never use JavaScript. Not because I think it's bad on the web, but this is a blog / portfolio, and I don't want to deal with the maintenance upkeep that anything more than HTML+CSS has. I also refused to use any CSS frameworks. It meant that writing the navbar took more than a couple months because I suck at CSS, but it means I never need to touch it again. No updating frameworks here. I do enough of that at my real job.
		</p>
		<p>
			As for how this website is updated, I write the HTML files directly and copy the template located at <a class="monospaced" href="/template.html">/template.html</a>. It's primitive, and it's a pain if I need to update the template, but that's rare and I can't be bothered to improve it beyond that because adding build steps adds more upkeep than it saves in avoiding copying templates around.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've considered doing more fancy things with this website than a plain HTML+CSS website. I do have some pretty good ideas, all things considered. But in the end I just wanted a plain website I could put thoughts like this one up and have nobody read. If you've read this far, congratulations!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are still interested in how this website works, the source code is open source at <a href="https://github.com/chbachman/chbachman.github.io/"> GitHub</a>. But it's not like that really matters, given that this website isn't even compressed/minified. Just <span class="monospaced">Save -> Save As -> Page Source</span>. I'll eventually get around to releasing some of this code as MIT or somesuch, but you probably shouldn't be using my code anyway.
